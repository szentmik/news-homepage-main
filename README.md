## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- W3.CSS
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

I tried to write my CSS file as it appears in the html document. I wanted to do it at first with bootstrap but I decided to use the W3.CSS.

### Continued development

I know that everything looks a little bit messy and there are no too much comment in my code and maybe it could be shorter. In the future I will try to take care about it too.

### Useful resources

- [w3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for w3.css grid system. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
